Recall that in the single-variable case, extreme values (local extrema) occur at points where the first derivative is zero, however, the vanishing of the first derivative is not a sufficient condition for a local max or min.  Generally, we apply the second derivative test to determine whether a candidate point is a max or min (sometimes it fails - if the second derivative either does not exist or is zero).  In the multivariate case, the first and second derivatives are *matrices*.  In the case of a scalar-valued function on $\\mathbb{R}^n$, the first derivative is an $n\\times 1$ vector called the *gradient* (denoted $\\nabla f$). The second derivative is an $n\\times n$ matrix called the *Hessian* (denoted $H$)\n",
