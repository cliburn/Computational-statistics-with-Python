      "**Exercise 4**. A Caesar cipher replaces each in a string with the letter $k$ modulo 26 positions down. For example, with $k=3$, 'a' would become 'd', 'b' would become 'e' and so on. The Caesar cipher is very easy to crack, since the relative letter frequencies are preserved - that is, 'e' is the most commonly used English letter, so the most frequent letter in the cipher is likely to be the code for 'e'. We can download a large corpus of English text (e.g. a few books from Project Gutenberg), and estimate the individual letter frequencies. Using for example, a multinomial model where each letter is one of 26 possibiilites with frequencies given by the the previous estimates, and assuming that each letter is independent, we can simply go through all 26 possible values of $k$ and choose the model with the highest likelihood. Or just use $\\chi^2$ statistic to compare observed and expected frequencies.\n",
