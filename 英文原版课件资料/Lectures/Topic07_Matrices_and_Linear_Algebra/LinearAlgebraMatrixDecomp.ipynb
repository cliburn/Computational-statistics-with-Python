The goal was to make predict a user's rating of a movie, based on previous ratings *and* ratings of 'similar' users.  The task amounted to analysis of a $400,000\\times 18,000$ matrix!  The wikipedia link above describes the contest and the second link is a very detailed description of the method (which took into account important characteristics such as how tastes may change over time).  Part of the analysis is related to matrix decomposition - we won't go into the details of the winning algorithm, but we will spend some time on basic matrix decompositions."
