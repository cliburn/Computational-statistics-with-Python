      "Most of science, including statsitcs, revolves around the design of models to represent data of some sort. In statistics, these models are typically probability distributions with parameters to estimate. The typical stages of analysis goes something like this:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Data management \n",
      "    1. Receive possibly messy and bad data\n",
      "    2. Clean and filter the data \n",
      "2. Expoloratory data analysis\n",
      "    1. Describe and visualize the data to come up with possible models\n",
      "3. Statistical inference\n",
      "    1. Estimate model parameters given data (Model estimation and selection)\n",
      "    2. Make predictions with model (Model prediction)\n",
      "4. Reporting\n",
      "\n",
      "In today's context, statisticians will be doing all three stages in front of a computer. We believe that modern analysiis of massive data sets is best achieved using a combination of complementatry software tools, and the course will cover what we consider to be an essential toolkit comprising `bash`, `git`, `make`, `sqlite3`, `python`, `R`, `C` and `LaTeX`. We use Python as the computational \"glue\" that integrates this collection of tools, and also in its capacity as an efficient high-level language for scientiific and statistical computing.\n",
      "\n",
      "To deal with the massive data sets that you will enocounter in your career, the course will emphasize reproducible analysis, code optimization, high-perforamnce computing and cloud computing. Examples will be drawn from the core topics in computational statistics of optimization (e.g. smoothing, interpolation, maximum lkelihood, constrained and unconstrained methods) and simulation (e.g. jackknife, bootstrap, permutation, Monte Carlo integrals, MCMC).\n",
      "\n",
      "At the end of the course, these are the practical skills every student should learn:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. How to set up a reproducible analysis pipeline using bash, git, make and LaTeX\n",
      "2. How to clean, manage and manipulate huge data sets using text processing, relational databases\n",
      "3. How to explore data sets interactively using the IPython notebook and visualization packages\n",
      "4. How to code statistical routines efficiently in high level languages \n",
      "5. How to optimize statistical routines by compiling to native code\n",
      "6. How to compute in parallel on multi-core machines, clusters and GPUs\n",
      "\n",
      "In particular, students should be able to write readable, well-documented, efficient (and if necessary parallel) code to implement a statistical method described in a textbook or paper, and apply it to real-world, possibly messy, data sets.\n",
