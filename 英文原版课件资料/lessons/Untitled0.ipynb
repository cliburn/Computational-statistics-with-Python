      "GPU stands for \"Graphics Processing Unit\", so called because the technology was developed in the video game industry.  These are devices with hundreds (to thousands) of processors, allowing for massive parallel computing.  Until recently, programming GPU devices was extremely difficult, as one had to write assembler code. \n",
