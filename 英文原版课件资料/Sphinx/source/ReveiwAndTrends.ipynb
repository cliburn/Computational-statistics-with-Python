    "# What you should know and learn more about\n",
    "\n",
    "## Statistical foundations\n",
    "\n",
    "- Experimental design\n",
    "    - Usualy want to isolate a main effect from confounders\n",
    "    - Can we use a randomized experiment design?\n",
    "        - Batch effects\n",
    "- Replication\n",
    "    - Essential for science\n",
    "- Exploratory data analysis\n",
    "    - Always eyeball the data\n",
    "    - Facility with graphics librareis is essential\n",
    "    - Even better are interactive graphics libraries (IPython notebook is ideal)\n",
    "        - Bokeh\n",
    "- As amount of data grows\n",
    "    - Simple algorithms may perform better than complex ones\n",
    "    - Non-parametric models may perform better than parametric ones\n",
    "    - But big data can often be interpreted as many pieces of small data\n",
    "\n",
    "## Computing foundations\n",
    "\n",
    "- Polyglot programming\n",
    "    - R and/or SAS (for statistical libraries)\n",
    "    - Python (for glue and data munging)\n",
    "\t- C/C++ (for high performance)\n",
    "    - Command line tools and [Unix philosophy](http://www.faqs.org/docs/artu/ch01s06.html)\n",
    "    - SQL (for managing data)\n",
    "\t- Scala (for Spark)\n",
    "- Need for concurrency\n",
    "    - Functional style is increasingly important\n",
    "        - Prefer immutable data structures\n",
    "\t    - Prefer pure functions\n",
    "            - Same input always gives same output\n",
    "\t        - Does not cause any side effects\n",
    "- With big data, lazy evaluation can be helpful\n",
    "    - Prefer generators to lists\n",
    "    - Look at the `itertools` standaard library in Python 2\n",
    "- Composability for maintainability and extensibility\n",
    "    - Small pieces, loosely joined\n",
    "    - Combinator pattern\n",
    "\t- Again, all this was in the original [Unix philosophy](http://www.faqs.org/docs/artu/ch01s06.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mathematical foundations\n",
    "\n",
    "- Core: probability and linear algebra\n",
    "- Calculus is important but secondary\n",
    "- Graphs and networks increasingly relevant\n",
    "\n",
    "## Statistical algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "- Numbers as leaky abstractions\n",
    "- Don't just use black boxes\n",
    "    - Make an effort to understand what each algorithm you call is doing\n",
    "    - At minimum, can you explain what the algorithm is doing in plain English?\n",
    "    - Can you implement a simple version from the ground up?\n",
    "- Categories of algorithms\n",
    "    - Big matrix manipulations (matrix decomposition is key)\n",
    "    - Continuous optimization - order 0, 1, 2\n",
    "\t- EM algorithm has wide applicability in both frequentist and Bayesian domains\n",
    "\t- Monte Carlo methods, MCMC and simulations\n",
    "- Making code fast\n",
    "    - Make it run, make it right, make it fast\n",
    "    - Python has amazing profiling tools - use them\n",
    "\t- For profiling C code, try [gperftools](https://code.google.com/p/gperftools/)\n",
    "\t- Compilation: Try numba or Cython in preference to writing raw C/C++\n",
    "\t- Parallel programming\n",
    "\t    - Python GIL\n",
    "\t    - Use Queue from threading or multiprocessing to build a pipeline\n",
    "\t\t- Skip OpenMP (except within Cython) and MPI\n",
