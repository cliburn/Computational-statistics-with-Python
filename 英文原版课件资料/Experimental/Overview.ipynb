      "The goal of STA 663 is to learn statistical programming - how to write code to solve statistical problems. In general, statistical problems have to do with the estimation of some characteristic derived from data - this can be a point estimate, an interval, or an entire function. Almost always, solving such statistical problems involves writing code to collect, organize, explore, analyze and present the data. For obvious reasons, we would like to write *good* code that is *readable*, *correct* and *efficient*, preferably without reinventing the wheel. \n",
      "\n",
      "This course will cover general ideas relevant for high-performance code (data structures, algorithms, code optimization including parallelization) as well as specific numerical methods important for data analysis (computer numbers, matrix decompositions, linear and nonlinear regression, numerial optimization, function estimation, Monte Carlo methods). We will mostly assume that you are comfortable with basic programming concepts (functions, classes, loops), have good habits (literate programming, testing, version control) and a decent mathematical and statistical background (linear algebra, calculus, probability).\n",
      "\n",
      "To solve statistical problems, you will typically need to (1) have the basic skills to collect, organize, explore and present the data, (2) apply specific numerical methods to analyze the data and (3) optimize the code to make it run acceptably fast (increasingly important in this era of \"big data\"). STA 663 is organized in 3 parts to reflect these stages of statistical programming - basics, numerical methods and high performance computing.\n",
