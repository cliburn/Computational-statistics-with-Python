      "Instructions for Final Project (25%)\n",
      "----\n",
      "\n",
      "For the final project, you will need to implement a \"new\" statistical algorithm in Python from the research literature and write a report on it (in an IPython notebook, of course!). As a guide, the report should include most or all of the following sections, although it is up to you which aspects you choose to focus on (e.g. if the algorithm is highly complex, just developing and testing the Python code might be the main emphasis; alternartively, if the algorithm is quite straightforward, the emphasis can be on making a CUDA version and benchmarking it):\n",
      "\n",
      "Note that for this project, you will be working with IPython notebooks, python scripts (e.g. test code), possibly code in other languages (e.g. Cython, C), data files and a MakeFile.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Background\n",
      "\n",
      "State the research paper you are using. Describe the concept of the algorithm and why it is interesting and/or useful. If appropriate, describe the mathematical basis of the algorithm. Some potential topics for the backgorund include:\n",
      "\n",
      "- What problem does it address? \n",
      "- What are known and possible applications of the algorithm? \n",
      "- What are its advantages and disadvantages relative to other algorithms?\n",
      "- How will you use it in your research?\n",
      "\n",
      "### Implementation\n",
      "\n",
      "Implement the algorithm as a Python function or family of functions as clearly as possible. Can your code be understood by someone with a similar quantitative background as yours? Does it follow good coding conventions?\n",
      "\n",
      "### Testing\n",
      "\n",
      "Write unit tests for your functions and make sure they pass. These should include both common and edge cases (e.g. test at boundaries - what happens if the input is an empty vector etc.).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Optimization\n",
      "\n",
      "Profile the performance of the algorithm and identify bottlenecks. Eliminate these bottlenecks where possible using vectorization, Cython and/or just-in-time compiling. Document what you did and the resulting performance improvement.\n",
      "\n",
      "### High performance computing\n",
      "\n",
      "If you can identify tasks tht can be performed in parallel, parallelize the algorithm. Depending on the algorithm, this may involve the use of multiprocessing, OpenMP, MPI, GPU prgoramming or map-reduce versions (or some combination of them). If the algorithm cannot be parallelized, more weight will be given to how effectively you perform optimization using Cython or just-in-time compilation. Document what you did and the resulting performance improvement.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Application and comparison\n",
      "\n",
      "Apply the algorithm to a \"real\" problem (this can be simulated data) to show how it works and to compare it with at least one other algorithm that addresses the same problem from some available Python or R package. \n",
      "\n",
      "### Reproducible analysis\n",
      "\n",
      "You are expected to perform the entire development process using a new GitHub repository with regular commits. The GitHub repository should contain a Makefile that can run all tests, as well as perform profiling and benchmarking.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rough Rubric \n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "The total points possible is 160, but you will receive at most 100 points, so you don't need to focus on all aspects. In particular, if a section (e.g. parallelization and high performance computing) is not relevant, you can skip it entirely and make up the points by doing excellent work in other sections. Note that scoring 30-40 points in the optimization, high performance computing or applicaiton/comparative analysis sections is reserved for *really impressive* work and routine work can expect a score of 10-20 points.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Descritpion of algorithm and the problems it solves (10 points)\n",
      "    - Can your classmate understand how the algorihtm works and how it can be potentially be used in her research?\n",
      "- Documentation, use of literate programming and readability (10 points)\n",
      "    - Are markup and code cells used appropirately?\n",
      "    - Is the code clear and understnadable?\n",
      "    - Is there adequeate but not excessvive comments and docstrings?\n",
      "- Profiling, optimization and code efficiency - i.e. good use of Python speed idioms, vectorization and/or compilation to native code (up to 40 points)\n",
      "    - As an example, a 40-point answer would include a naive, a vectorrized and a Cytonized version of a *relatively complex* algorithm and clearly show efficiecny gains with each version\n",
      "- Profiling, parallelization and high performance computing - i.e. mulitcore, OpenMP, MPI, Hadoop/Spark and/or GPU programming (up to 40 points)\n",
      "    - As an example, a 40-point answwr could be a dmonstrably correct *novel* Hadoop/Spark or GPU implemntation with impressvie speedups over the original algorithm\n",
      "- Application to simulated/real problem and comparative anlaysis (up to 40 points) \n",
      "    - As an example, a 40-point answer could include an *extensive* comparative analysis against the majority of classes of existing algorithms used to solve a problem with benchmarking and a thoguhtful consideration of the benefits/drawbacks of each\n",
      "- Unit testing of code (10 points)\n",
      "    - How complete is the code coverage?\n",
      "- Good use of GitHub and Makefile (10 points)\n",
      "    - Are commits regularly made with informative log messages?\n",
      "    - Can tests, benchmark and sample applications be easily and flexibly run with make? "
