The first function `plot_newton_iters(f, fprime, n=200, extent=[-1,1,-1,1], cmap='hsv')` calculates and stores the number of iterations taken for convergence (or max_iter) for each point in a 2D array. The 2D array limits are given by `extent` - for example, when `extent = [-1,1,-1,1]` the corners of the plot are `(-i, -i), (1, -i), (1, i), (-1, i)`. There are `n` grid points in both the real and imaginary axes. The argument `cmap` specifies the color map to use - the suggested defaults are fine. Finally plot the image using `plt.imshow` - make sure the axis ticks are correctly scaled. Make a plot for the cube roots of 1.\n",

The second function `plot_newton_basins(f, fprime, n=200, extent=[-1,1,-1,1], cmap='jet')` has the same arguments, but this time the grid stores the identity of the root that the starting point converged to. Make a plot for the cube roots of 1 - since there are 3 roots, there should be only 3 colors in the plot."
